# Exploiting XSS to perform CSRF

In this challenge, we need to perform XSS and CSRF attack. In details, we need to create a payload that force user to change their email without their consent. There's actually few ways to solve the challenge, including using XMLHttpRequest, Using Form Action, or using fetch function. Here I'll perform using the **XMLHttpRequest** solution.

Here we can see an account page, where our user email is: **wiener@normal-user.net**
